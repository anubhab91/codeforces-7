# Codeforces
- This repo includes all my Codeforces solutions.
- The combination of number and letter at the beginning of each solution indicates the corresponding problem on Codeforces. For instance, the file "1A - Theatre Square.py" is a solution to the problem presented at http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1/A.
- Each solution was able to pass the corresponding test suite provided by Codeforces upon commit. You can use and distribute the solutions, but there is absolutely no guarantee of the efficiency or even validity as of right now.
